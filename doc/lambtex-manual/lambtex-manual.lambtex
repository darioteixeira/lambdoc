\title{The \lambtex Manual}

\rule

\p<initial>{\lambtex is a document description language.  It is largely inspired by
\caps{LaTeX}\cite{bib:latex}, both in its syntax and in the approach taken for the
description of documents.  In basic terms, the source for a \lambtex document is composed
only of text, but annotated with special commands that attach a precise semantical
meaning to elements.  There are commands that format passages in a special manner
(emphasised, superscript, etc), and commands that declare high-level constructs such as
section headings, quotation blocks, boxouts, or images.  \lambtex was especially designed
to be used in web applications, and as such it supports fully hyperlinked documents.
Moreover, its syntax is simple, consistent, and designed with brevity in mind.}

This manual is divided into two main parts plus an appendix.  \sref{part:basic}
introduces the basic principles of the language; these allow you to describe simple
documents with formatted text, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, tabular
environments, and other features.  \sref{part:advanced} describes the advanced
features of the language; these enable documents to have internal links, sectioning,
a bibliography, notes, etc.  Finally, there is an \mref{part:theappendix}{appendix}
providing reference information concerning miscelaneous issues which do not fit into
the main flow of the manual.

Note that there is a good reason behind such a stark demarcation between the
composition/manuscript classes of features.  In \lambdoc --- the library that provides
support for \lambtex --- a document that uses both basic and advanced features is
termed a \emph{manuscript}, and may, for instance, be the main story on a blog post
or article\cite{bib:lambdoc}.  On the other hand, documents that only use the basic
features are termed \emph{compositions}, and may be used as comments to the main story.


\part[part:basic]{Essential \lambtex}


\section[sec:anatomy]{The anatomy of \lambtex documents}

A \lambtex document is essentially a sequence of blocks.  A block is for example
a paragraph of text, a section heading, a figure, or a table.  Blocks typically
occupy the full width of the page and are vertically separated from other blocks by a
small margin.  In the document source, whitespace is irrelevant when it comes to the
separation of blocks.

Many blocks are composed of \emph{inline text}.  Paragraphs and section headings are good
examples of such blocks.  Inline text is a sequence of plain text and special characters
intermixed with sequences of emphasised text, superscript text, etc.  You can thus speak
of \emph{block-level} and \emph{inline-level} elements in a \lambtex document.

Inline-level elements are declared by \emph{simple} commands, while block-level elements
may be declared by either simple or \emph{environment} commands\see{note:commands}.
The former take the generic shape \code{\\\emph{command}\{...\}}, where the content
inside the curly brackets constitutes the parameters to the command.  Note that some
simple commands may take more than one parameter (in which case more than one set of
curly brackets is used), while others exist that take no parameters at all.  As for
environment commands, they are composed of two parts: an initial and a final tag, which
together delineate the contents of the environment.  The initial tag takes the form
\code{\\begin\{\emph{command}\}}, while the final tag is \code{\\end\{\emph{command}\}}.

\begin[note:commands]{note}
As stated, any given command may either be expressed by the simple notation or as
an environment.  This should be interpreted an exclusive-\caps{or} condition, meaning
that no command exists that can be expressed as both.  However, the choice of adopting
one or the other notation was not an arbitrary one.  Due to its syntactic terseness,
the simple notation was preferred.  The more verbose environment notation was chosen
only for those commands that satisfied at least one of the two following conditions:

\begin{ul}
\li	The command may be the parent of at least one block-level element.
\li	The command declares a verbatim-like environment using the \caps{heredoc}
	technique for delimitation (see \sref{sec:verbatim} for an example).
\end{ul}
\end{note}

Besides the (normally mandatory) primary parameters, many simple and environment
commands accept other classes of parameters, typically optional\see{note:optional}.
In total there are three of these other classes: order parameters, label parameters, and
extra parameters.  The first are enclosed by round brackets and are used to override the
automatic ordering associated with blocks such as sections and equations.  The second
are enclosed by square brackets and are used for assigning a label to any block that
may be referenced from somewhere else in the document.  Finally, extra parameters are
enclosed between angle brackets and are used to customise command specific settings.
For the sake of reference, \sref{tab:parameters} lists all the classes of parameters
and the characters used for enclosing them.

\begin[note:optional]{note}
While the qualifier \emph{typically} implies a degree of uncertainty concerning the
optionality of these parameters, in practice you may treat them as truly optional.
The qualifier exists because there is one (and only one!) exception, which applies
to environments not normally used in regular documents.  Namely, inside sub-pages the
order parameter is mandatory for a number of blocks (see \sref{sec:order} for details).
\end{note}

Not all of the optional parameters are available for all commands.  There are in fact
many commands for which none is applicable.  Moreover, for those commands where one
or more optional arguments are accepted, they may be specified in any order as long
as they appear before any of the primary (curly bracketed) parameters.

\begin[tab:parameters]{table}
{The four classes of parameters that may be given to \lambtex commands.
Primary parameters are typically mandatory and are enclosed by curly brackets.
Order, label, and extra parameters are usually optional and are enclosed by
round, square, and angle brackets, respectively.}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\head
|		|{2c_} Markers			|
| Parameter	| Begin		| End		|
\body
| Order		| \code{(}	| \code{)}	|
| Label		| \code{[}	| \code{]}	|
| Extra		| \code{<}	| \code{>}	|
| Primary	| \code{\{}	| \code{\}}	|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section[sec:paragraphs]{Paragraph blocks}

Paragraphs are the simplest of all blocks, typically being composed of just a sequence
of inline text terminated by a blank line.  It is however also possible to declare
a paragraph via the simple command \code{\\paragraph} or its synonym \code{\\p}.
Should you choose the simple command, the paragraph contents are to be specified inside
the mandatory curly brackets.  Consider thus the following \lambtex source fragment:

\begin{source}
This is the first example of a paragraph.  Note that
it is composed of inline text.

Lines can be broken at any point, because a paragraph
is only terminated by a blank line. \br
It is however possible to manually insert a line break
without terminating the paragraph.

\p{There is also a simple command that allows the
explicit declaration of a paragraph.}
\end{source}

The result produced by the composer is as follows:

\begin{subpage}
This is the first example of a paragraph.  Note that
it is composed of inline text.

Lines can be broken at any point, because a paragraph
is only terminated by a blank line. \br
It is however possible to manually insert a line break
without terminating the paragraph.

\p{There is also a simple command that allows the
explicit declaration of a paragraph.}
\end{subpage}

Note that the line breaks within the text are irrelevant for the composer; all that
it cares about are that blank lines separate paragraphs.  if you wish for a line break
within a paragraph (ie, without terminating the current paragraph), use the \code{\\br}
simple command, as demonstrated.

Using the command \code{\\paragraph} (or its synonym \code{\\p}) to declare a
paragraph is usually neither necessary nor recommended.  This method exists for the
sole reason that it may be desirable to provide the composer with extra parameters
about the paragraph.  Presently, the extra parameters accepted are \code{initial}
and \code{indent}.  The former is a boolean which signals whether the first letter of
the paragraph should be rendered in a special manner.  Its default value is always
\code{false}, so you must explicitly set it to \code{true} when needed.  The latter
indicates whether the paragraph should be indented, and is tripartite in value.  The
values it accepts are \code{auto} (the default), \code{true}, or \code{false}.  In most
situations the \code{auto} algorithm should be good enough: it indents a paragraph only
if immediately preceded by another paragraph.  There are however situations where you
may indeed require an override by explicitly setting the indentation to \code{true}
or \code{false}.

At this point we recommend that you consult \sref{sec:extra}, which dives into more
detail on the subject of extra parameters.  There you can learn of shorthand manners
of inputting booleans and other values.


\section{Formatting inline text}

As shown by \sref{tab:inline}, \lambtex offers a broad set of text formatting commands.
Remember that besides their application inside paragraph blocks, any of these commands
may also be used in a context where inline text is allowed.  That means you may use them
in section titles, figure captions, inside tables, etc.  Note that all inline formatting
commands take as parameter a sequence of inline text.  It is thus perfectly possible to
nest these commands without any restrictions.  Moreover, some of these commands have
(typically shorter) synonyms.  Therefore, instead of \code{\\bold} you can also just
type \code{\\b}.

\begin[tab:inline]{table}
{List of all text formatting commands, including synonyms where
applicable.  All these commands take one parameter enclosed in
curly brackets.  The parameter is a sequence of inline text.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Command						| Example							|
\body
| \code{\\bold\{\emph{inline}\}}			| You can make some passages be \bold{bold}.\br
							  (Synonyms: \code{\\strong} and \code{\\b})			|
| \code{\\emph\{\emph{inline}\}}			| Here's another way to \emph{emphasise} text.\br
							  (Synonyms: \code{\\em} and \code{\\i})			|
| \code{\\code\{\emph{inline}\}}			| You can also imitate a \code{typewriter}.\br
							  (Synonym: \code{\\tt})					|
| \code{\\caps\{\emph{inline}\}}			| \lambtex supports text in small-caps.				|
| \code{\\ins\{\emph{inline}\}}				| Sometimes it's \ins{very} handy to insert new text.		|
| \code{\\del\{\emph{inline}\}}				| You may also fix \del{annoyingly} incorrect passages.		|
| \code{\\sup\{\emph{inline}\}}				| The 1\sup{st} of January has a superscript.			|
| \code{\\sub\{\emph{inline}\}}				| H\sub{2}O requires a subscript.				|
| \code{\\mbox\{\emph{inline}\}}			| The inline sequence should not be split across lines.		|
| \code{\\span\{\emph{inline}\}}			| You may create spans with custom classnames.			|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While most commands listed in the table above should have a straightforward application,
a few clarifying words concerning \code{\\span} are in order.  This command translates
directly into an \caps{xhtml} \code{span} element; moreover, it accepts a class name
declaration via the optional extra parameter \code{class}.  In \lambdoc's default
configuration, this class name is prepended by '\code{doc_span_}' and output as the
\code{span} element's own class name in the \caps{xhtml} output.  Combined with a
suitable \caps{css} declaration, this allows the definition of custom formatting for
certain passages.  Note, however, that the class name has two constraints.  First,
the allowed character set is limited to lowercase roman letters, digits, and the
characters '\code{.}' (period), '\code{:}' (colon), '\code{-}' (dash), and '\code{_}'
(underscore).  Second, the first character must be a letter.


\section{Special characters}

\lambtex allows the direct use of \caps{html} entities via the same notation used
in \caps{html}.  More precisely, entities are to be enclosed between the characters
'\code{\&}' (ampersand) and '\code{;}' (semicolon), and may be specified by the so-called
\emph{character entity reference} (ie, the entity's name), or by \emph{numeric character
reference} (ie, a \caps{unicode} code point in decimal or hexadecimal notation).
As an example, if the \caps{euro} symbol '\code{&euro;}' is not readily available in
your keyboard, you may enter it in either of the following three manners:

\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\head
| Name			| Decimal		| Hexadecimal		|
\body
| \code{\&euro;}	| \code{\&#8364;}	| \code{\&#x20ac;}	|
\end{tabular}

The reader will have noted that \lambtex must interpret the character '\code{\&}'
(ampersand) differently, and therefore you need a workaround if you want to input an
actual ampersand.  In fact, there are other characters besides the ampersand that are
interpreted differently by \lambtex, and as such also require a special escaping
sequence.  These characters are '\code{\\}' (backslash), '\code{\{}' (opening curly
bracket), and '\code{\}}' (closing curly bracket).  The character used for escaping
is the backslash, which means that displaying an ampersand, for example, is achieved
with \code{\\\&}.  Another option in this particular case is of course to use the
\code{amp} \caps{html} entity\see{note:ampersand}.

\begin[note:ampersand]{note}
Note that in most practical situations you can get away with inputting an ampersand
directly without escaping.  This is because the scanner will only interpret an ampersand
as the beginning of an entity declaration if it is immediately followed by an alphabetic
or numeric sequence terminated by a semicolon.  If it is not, then the ampersand is
interpreted as plain text.
\end{note}

Besides individual characters, there are also some multi-character sequences that are
interpreted differently by \lambtex.  \sref{tab:seq} lists all of them.  Remember to
use the escape character if you wish to input any of these sequences literally.

\begin[tab:seq]{table}
{Special character sequences and their \lambtex interpretation.  Remember
to use the backslash for escaping if you wish to input any of these sequences
verbatim.  Also, see \sref{sec:math} for details about entering mathematics.}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\head
| Sequence		| Translation |
\body
| \code{[\$}		| Beginning of inline \caps{TeX} mathematics |
| \code{\$]}		| End of inline \caps{TeX} mathematics |
| \code{<\$}		| Beginning of inline \caps{MathML} |
| \code{\$>}		| End of inline \caps{MathML} |
\body
| \code{\-\-\-}		| Typographic em-dash |
| \code{\-\-}		| Typographic en-dash |
| \code{\`\`}		| Opening double quotes |
| \code{\'\'}		| Closing double quotes |
\end{tabular}
\end{table}



\section{Hyperlinks to external resources}

The simple command \code{\\link} (or its synonym \code{\\a}) allows
the creation of hyperlinks into any external resource.  It takes the form
\code{\\link\{\emph{uri}\}\{\emph{inline}\}}, where \code{\emph{uri}} is the raw text
containing the address (\caps{uri}) of the target, and \code{\emph{inline}} is the
sequence of inline text that will actually be displayed.  Should the two be the same,
you may ommit the second parameter altogether.  Moreover, note that in no circumstances
may you nest a link inside another!\see{note:links}

\begin[note:links]{note}
The \caps{xhtml} standard forbids nested links.  Curiously enough, however, the \caps{w3c}'s
own famous \link{http://validator.w3.org/}{validator} is unable to detect such violations
of the specification.
\end{note}

Note that in the preceeding paragraph, the sequence \code{\emph{uri}} is described as
\emph{raw} text, not an inline sequence.  In brief, a raw sequence is one whose contents
are parsed verbatim, without (almost) any attempt to expand special characters and where
inline formatting commands do not apply.  In similarity to their inline counterparts,
raw sequences are delimited by curly brackets.  Therefore, the end of sequence character
'\code{\}}' is interpreted specially.  Escaping is also possible, and thus the backslash
character is also special.

\lambtex supports also internal targets and hyperlinks.  These are part of the advanced
features of the language, however, not being discussed before \sref{sec:intlinks}.

\section{List environments}

All the commands we have seen so far are simple commands, and therefore the declaration
of lists will provide us with the first example of environment commands.  Lists in
\lambtex come in three varieties: ordered, unordered, and description lists.
These are declared using the environment commands \code{enumerate}, \code{itemize},
and \code{description}, respectively.  As shown by the following \lambtex source,
items in ordered and unordered lists must be preceded by the parameterless simple
command \code{\\item}.  As for description lists, each item must be preceded also by
the simple command \code{\\item}.  However, in this latter case the command takes a
mandatory inline sequence as parameter.  Finally, lists may be nested, and each item may
itself be composed of several blocks (see \sref{sec:structure} for a detailed description
concerning the structure of \lambtex documents).  Consider thus the following source:


\begin{source}
Here is a list of small furry mammals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cat
\item Some dog breeds:
	\begin{description}
	\item{poodle:} Small dogs kept for company
	\item{greyhound:} Running dogs
	\end{description}
\item Various rodents ordered by abundance:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rat
	\item Hamster
	\item Capivara
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{source}


The output generated by the composer is as follows:


\begin{subpage}
Here is a list of small furry mammals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Cat
\item Some dog breeds:
	\begin{description}
	\item{poodle:} Small dogs kept for company
	\item{greyhound:} Running dogs
	\end{description}
\item Various rodents ordered by abundance:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rat
	\item Hamster
	\item Capivara
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{subpage}

For the sake of brevity and for compatibility with \caps{html} standards, you
may also use the synonyms \code{ol}, \code{ul}, \code{dl}, and \code{\\li}, for
\code{enumerate}, \code{itemize}, \code{description}, and \code{\\item}, respectively.
Moreover, the British spelling \code{itemise} may be used for ordered lists.  However,
the start and end tags must still match: though, for example, \code{ol} is a synonym
for \code{enumerate}, if you start an ordered list with \code{\\begin\{ol\}} you must
terminate it with \code{\\end\{ol\}}.

It is possible to customise the bullet used in unordered lists or the numbering system
used in ordered lists.  To do so you need to pass an extra parameter to either the
\code{\\begin\{itemize\}} or \code{\\begin\{enumerate\}} commands.  Remember that extra
parameters are enclosed between angle brackets, and are to be placed before a command's
opening curly brackets (check \sref{sec:extra} for a more thorough description of
extra parameters).  \mbox{Tables \ref{tab:itemize} and \ref{tab:enumerate}} list the
available options for the itemize and enumerate environments, respectively.


\begin[tab:itemize]{table}
{Available extra parameters for the \code{itemize} command.  These allow you
to change the bullet marking each list item.  For completeness, each of the
values above should be prefixed by \code{bul=}, though the prefix is optional.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Value			| Type of bullet		|
\body
| \code{disc}		| A filled circle.		|
| \code{circle}		| An empty circle.		|
| \code{square}		| A square.			|
| \code{none}		| Ommit the bullet altogether.	|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\begin[tab:enumerate]{table}
{Available extra parameters for the \code{enumerate} command.  These allow you
to change the numbering scheme ordering each list item.  For completeness, each
of the values above should be prefixed by \code{num=}, though the prefix is optional.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Value					| Type of numbering				|
\body
| \code{decimal}, \code{0}		| Decimal numbers.				|
| \code{lower-roman}, \code{i}		| Lower-case Roman numerals.			|
| \code{upper-roman}, \code{I}		| Upper-case Roman numerals.			|
| \code{lower-alpha}, \code{a}		| Lower-case letters in the Latin alphabet.	|
| \code{upper-alpha}, \code{A}		| Upper-case letters in the Latin alphabet.	|
| \code{none}				| Ommit the numbering altogether.		|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section[sec:qanda]{Q&A environments}

Somewhat related to lists, Q&A environments are used to mark a sequence of questions
and accompanying answers, as typically found in interviews.  The environment is bounded
by the start/end tag \code{qanda}, and expects an alternating sequence of question and
answer blocks, delimited by the simple commands \code{\\question} and \code{\\answer},
respectively.  The latter commands accept an inline sequence delimited by curly
brackets as optional parameter.  If present, this sequence indicates the text that
should appear before the actual question or answer; it is used to indicate the name
of the interviewer or the interviewee, respectively.  Should this sequence be fixed
for the entire length of the Q&A, there is an alternative to repeating it with each
\code{\\question} and\code{\\answer} pair: you may instead use the parameterless simple
commands \code{\\rquestion} and \code{\\ranswer}.  These simply reuse the sequence
declared in the previous question or answer.  The following example illustrates the
pattern:

\begin{source}
\begin{qanda}
\question{Egg Gazette:}
On which side of the egg opening debate are you?

\answer{John McAuthor:}
I sustain that eggs should be opened by their small-end, of course.

\question{EG:}
What's your opinion on the contrarian position,
that eggs should be opened by their large-end?

\answer{JM:}
Sheer madness!

\rquestion
Could you elaborate?

\ranswer
I don't believe that to be necessary; the reasons are self-evident.
\end{qanda}
\end{source}

The generated output is as follows:

\begin{subpage}
\begin{qanda}
\question{Egg Gazette:}
On which side of the egg opening debate are you?

\answer{John McAuthor:}
I sustain that eggs should be opened by their small-end, of course.

\question{EG:}
What's your opinion on the contrarian position,
that eggs should be opened by their large-end?

\answer{JM:}
Sheer madness!

\rquestion
Could you elaborate?

\ranswer
I don't believe that to be necessary; the reasons are self-evident.
\end{qanda}
\end{subpage}


\section[sec:verse]{Verse environments}

The environment \code{verse} is used to typeset poetry, music lyrics, or any other
content where conventional typographic rules for verses apply.  Inside the environment
only paragraph blocks are accepted; each paragraph corresponds to a stanza, and each
verse should be terminated by the line break marker \code{\\br}.  Therefore, if you
wished to typeset the first couple of stanzas from Virgil's \emph{Aeneid}, this would
be the \lambtex source:

\begin{source}
\begin{verse}
Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris \br
Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit \br
litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto \br
vi superum saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram; \br
multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem, \br
inferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum, \br
Albanique patres, atque altae moenia Romae.

Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso, \br
quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus \br
insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores \br
impulerit.  Tantaene animis caelestibus irae? \br
\end{verse}
\end{source}

The result would be the following:

\begin{subpage}
\begin{verse}
Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris \br
Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit \br
litora, multum ille et terris iactatus et alto \br
vi superum saevae memorem Iunonis ob iram; \br
multa quoque et bello passus, dum conderet urbem, \br
inferretque deos Latio, genus unde Latinum, \br
Albanique patres, atque altae moenia Romae.

Musa, mihi causas memora, quo numine laeso, \br
quidve dolens, regina deum tot volvere casus \br
insignem pietate virum, tot adire labores \br
impulerit.  Tantaene animis caelestibus irae? \br
\end{verse}
\end{subpage}


\section[sec:quotations]{Quotations}

Quotation blocks are typically used for including an excerpt from an external source
into your document.  You may be quoting what someone said in an interview, or providing
context when replying to a comment, for example.  Quotation bloks are delimited by
the \code{quote} environment, and may enclose not only plain text paragraphs, but
also lists or any of the so-called \emph{quotable blocks}, as \sref{sec:structure}
describes in greater detail.  Consider thus the following \lambtex source:

\begin{source}
This is what you said:

\begin{quote}
Eggs should be opened by their large end.  Any other method is heresy.
It is therefore my opinion that John McAuthor is a heretic.
\end{quote}
\end{source}

This is the output produced:

\begin{subpage}
This is what you said:

\begin{quote}
Eggs should be opened by their large end.  Any other method is heresy.
It is therefore my opinion that John McAuthor is a heretic.
\end{quote}
\end{subpage}

Note that though undoubtedly indispensable, quotation blocks are prone to being abused.
Our advice is to use them only if embeddeding a quotation is essential to carry your
message.  You may, for example, be commenting on a particular sentence or paragraph
in an interview available online; in this case, a quotation block will provide the
focus that would have been lost by simply linking to the entire interview.


\section[sec:verbatim]{Verbatim environments}

Like their \caps{LaTeX} counterparts or the \caps{html} \code{pre} element, verbatim
environments allow the insertion of blocks where the text is shown \emph{as is}, ie,
without (almost) any attempt at the interpretation of its contents.  They are to be
displayed using a monospaced font, and as such are ideal for showing \caps{ascii}-art.
Another application is to display text-only technical diagrams as commonly found on
Internet \caps{rfc}s, for example.

The command name for the verbatim environment is \code{verbatim}, and being an
environment command the text must be enclosed between \code{\\begin\{verbatim\}} and
\code{\\end\{verbatim\}} markers.  The synonym \code{pre} may also be used.  Below is
an example of a diagram drawn using only \caps{ascii} characters, and rendered using
a \code{verbatim} environment:

\begin{verbatim}
             N
            /|\
           / | \
          /  |  \
         /   |   \
        /    |    \
       /     |     \
      N     '+'     L
     /|\            |
    / | \           |
   /  |  \          |
  /   |   \         |
 L   '+'   L       '3'
 |         |
'1'       '2'
\end{verbatim}

We say there is \emph{almost} no interpretation of the contents of the verbatim
environment because there is one exception.  The string \code{\\end\{verbatim\}}
is used as the end marker, and therefore the \lambtex scanner will exit the
environment if it encounters this string.  This raises the obvious question of how
one can insert that string itself within a verbatim context without triggering the
termination of the environment.  The solution used by \lambtex is reminescent of the
\link{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document}{\caps{heredoc}} approach used by
other languages.  Basically, the markers that delimit verbatim environments need only use
\code{verbatim} as a prefix.  The only condition for termination is that the end marker
matches the begin marker.  Therefore, to include the string \code{\\end\{verbatim\}}
within a verbatim environment, you can simply delimitate that environment with, for
example, \code{\\begin\{verbatim1\}} and \code{\\end\{verbatim1\}}.  Note that only
numbers and lowercase letters may be used as suffix characters.

Optionally, you may provide the extra parameter \code{mult} to a verbatim environment.
This parameter accepts an integer between 0 and 9, indicating a multiplying factor for
the contents of the environment.  For a factor of [$x$], the actual scaling relative
to normal size is given by [$\sqrt{2}^x$].  The default factor is 0, which corresponds
to normal size.  One common application of this feature is to display \caps{unicode}
characters as full-sized pictures.  As an example, this is what the \caps{unicode}
snowman (code point \caps{U+2603}) looks like with a multiplier of 7, corresponding
to a font size 11.3 times larger than normal:

\begin<7>{verbatim}
☃
\end{verbatim}


\section[sec:code]{Presenting source-code}

While it is of course possible to input source code listings using the above discussed
verbatim environment, \lambtex has a dedicated facility with a number of advantages.
This new environment is named \code{source}, and offers the possibility of adding line
numbers to the code listing and highlighting the source according to the syntax of most
popular languages.  You have in fact already encountered this environment multiple
times in this document: it has been used for formatting \lambtex source code, albeit
without line numbers or syntax highlighting.  Suppose thus you wish to pretty-print
an \link{http://caml.inria.fr/}{\caps{ocaml}} fragment.  You can declare a source-code
environment the following way:

\begin{source1}
\begin<lang=ocaml>{source}
type 'a tree =
	| Leaf of 'a
	| Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec count_leaves = function
	| Leaf _	-> 1
	| Node (a, b)	-> (count_leaves a) + (count_leaves b)
\end{source}
\end{source1}

Note that the source language is specified via an optional extra parameter \code{lang}.
In most cases the prefix \code{lang=} can be ommited and the language name may appear
by itself, since there is little chance for conflict with other extra parameters (see
\sref{sec:extra} for a more detailed discussion).  Also, the same \caps{heredoc}-like
technique used for verbatim environments can be used in a source environment if you
wish to include the string \code{\\end\{source\}} itself.  The astute reader will have
noticed that this trick must have been used in the source for this manual to display the
code above (this manual is itself written in \lambtex --- we do eat our own dog food).
Finally, the example above produces the following output:

\begin<lang=ocaml>{source}
type 'a tree =
	| Leaf of 'a
	| Node of 'a tree * 'a tree

let rec count_leaves = function
	| Leaf _	-> 1
	| Node (a, b)	-> (count_leaves a) + (count_leaves b)
\end{source}

Code environments offer three more customisation options via extra parameters.  First,
the boolean parameter \code{box} indicates whether the source should be displayed
inside a box, as in the examples above.  This is the default, though you may want
to set this option to \code{false} if you have short code segments that you wish to
integrate more tightly with the flow of the document text.  Second, the boolean parameter
\code{nums} indicates whether line numbers should be added to the listing.  Its default
is \code{true} if the source language was specified and the source is shown inside a
box; otherwise it is \code{false}.  Finally, the also boolean parameter \code{zebra}
controls the printing of the zebra stripes.  Its default value is \code{true} if the
source lies inside a box, and \code{false} otherwise.

To conclude, note that \lambtex offers also the possibility for code environments to
be numbered and referenced from anywhere in the document.  This can be done by wrapping
them inside a \code{printout} environment, and is part of the advanced features of
the language discussed in \sref{sec:wrappers}.


\section{Tabular environments}

Presenting data in a tabular format is indispensable for many classes of documents.
With this in mind, \lambtex offers a special \code{tabular} environment which
allows you to format tables in a simple and concise way, while retaining most of the
capabilities offered by \caps{LaTeX} and \caps{xhtml} tables.

Suppose then that our tabular data had three different attributes --- a person's
name, a phone number, and an address --- and that we had this information about four
different people.  We wish to present the attributes as table columns, whereas each
record will be shown in a different row.  In brief, a table just like the one below:

\begin{tabular}{lll}
\head
| Name		| Phone			| Address	|
\body
| John		| 123456		| London	|
| Mary		| 234567		| Paris		|
| Mark		| 345678		| Moscow	|
| Jane		| 456789		| Sydney	|
\end{tabular}

The tabular environment has one mandatory primary parameter: a string indicating the
number of columns and the formatting that should be applied to each column.  The example
above features three left-aligned columns; the corresponding string is \code{lll}.
If, for example, you had four columns aligned respectively to the left, right, center,
and left again, the parameter string would be \code{lrcl}. Consult \sref{tab:tabular}
for a list of all available column specifiers.

\begin[tab:tabular]{table}
{List of available column specifiers for tabular environments.
A specifier tells \lambtex how each column should be formatted.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Specifier	| Formatting |
\body
| \code{l}	| Column is left-aligned. |
| \code{L}	| Column is left-aligned and strong. |
| \code{r}	| Column is right-aligned. |
| \code{R}	| Column is right-aligned and strong. |
| \code{c}	| Column is centre-aligned. |
| \code{C}	| Column is centre-aligned and strong. |
| \code{j}	| Column is justified. |
| \code{J}	| Column is justified and strong. |
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Inside a tabular environment, a row is terminated when the character '\code{|}' is the
last on a line of text; within each row, cells must also be prefixed by the '\code{|}'
character.  This means that inside a tabular environment --- but here only! --- you'll
need to escape this character if you want to display an actual pipe character.

There are three different classes of rows available: header, body, and footer rows.
Besides formatting each one differently, smart enough browsers will know that table
headers are to be repeated if the tabular environment spans more than one printed page.
The parameterless simple commands \code{\\head}, \code{\\body}, and \code{\\foot}
are used inside a tabular environment to mark the beginning of each class.  Note that
header and footer rows are optional (in which case the \code{\\body} marker is also
optional, since rows are assumed by default to be body rows).  Moreover, you can
declare more than one group of body rows, and the default \caps{css} stylesheet will
visibly separate each group.

The code below is the source for the tabular environment listed above.  Note the use
of the \code{\\head} and \code{\\body} commands to delineate row classes, and how the
character '\code{|}' is used to separate cells and rows.

\begin{source}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\head
| Name		| Phone			| Address	|
\body
| John		| 123456		| London	|
| Mary		| 234567		| Paris		|
| Mark		| 345678		| Moscow	|
| Jane		| 456789		| Sydney	|
\end{tabular}
\end{source}

Some tables may require more sophisticated formatting.  The most common requirement is
for multi-column cells, and \lambtex does support them.  This feature is enabled by a
special syntax that allows the customisation of each individual cell.  More precisely,
the pipe character '\code{|}' that precedes each cell is optionally followed by a
curly bracketed expression containing the cell's formatting.

The formatting expression is composed of three parts.  First is an integer indicating
how many columns the cell should span; second is a single character matching one of
the specifiers listed in \sref{tab:tabular}; last and optional are the characters
'\code{_}' (underscore) and/or '\code{^}' (caret), which if present indicate that
a horizontal line should be put above or below the cell.  Note that the formatting
should satisfy the regular expression \mbox{\code{\emph{digit}+ \emph{spec} ( '_' |
'^' | '_^' | '^_' )?}}.

This discussion would not be complete without the presentation of a complete example
illustrating the application of advanced cell formatting.  Consider thus the \lambtex
fragment below, whose output is displayed in \sref{tab:species}.  Besides the use of
header, footer, and multiple body rows, also noteworthy are the cell configuration
expressions \code{2c_} and \code{2c^}, which configure their corresponding cells to
span two columns, be centered, and show a horizontal line below and above, respectively.

\begin{source}
\begin{tabular}{rll}
\head
|		|{2c_} Scientific name			|
| Common name	| Genus			| Species	|
\body
| Wolf		| \emph{Canis}		| \emph{lupus}	|
| Cat		| \emph{Felis}		| \emph{catus}	|
| Lion		| \emph{Panthera}	| \emph{leo}	|
\body
| English oak	| \emph{Quercus}	| \emph{robur}	|
| Cork oak	| \emph{Quercus}	| \emph{suber}	|
| European yew	| \emph{Taxus}		| \emph{baccata}|
\foot
| Common name	| Genus			| Species	|
|		|{2c^} Scientific name			|
\end{tabular}
\end{source}

To conclude, note that if you wish for a tabular environment to be numbered and
referenced from anywhere in the document, you need to wrap it inside a \code{table}.
This is part of the advanced features of the language, and is discussed in
\sref{sec:wrappers}.

\begin[tab:species]{table}
{The classification of some common animals and plants.  This table illustrates the use
of the advanced formatting facilities that enable customisation of individual cells.}
\begin{tabular}{rll}
\head
|		|{2c_} Scientific name			|
| Common name	| Genus			| Species	|
\body
| Wolf		| \emph{Canis}		| \emph{lupus}	|
| Cat		| \emph{Felis}		| \emph{catus}	|
| Lion		| \emph{Panthera}	| \emph{leo}	|
\body
| English oak	| \emph{Quercus}	| \emph{robur}	|
| Cork oak	| \emph{Quercus}	| \emph{suber}	|
| European yew	| \emph{Taxus}		| \emph{baccata}|
\foot
| Common name	| Genus			| Species	|
|		|{2c^} Scientific name			|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section[sec:math]{Mathematical formulas}

\lambtex also supports the inclusion of equations and mathematical formulas in a
document.  Mathematics are to be entered using either \caps{MathML}\cite{bib:mathml}
or the \caps{TeX}\cite{bib:tex} format.  The former was chosen because an increasing
number of tools has the ability to export \caps{MathML}.  As for the latter, it is
the \emph{de facto} standard for manually typing mathematical expressions.

Mathematical expressions may be entered in an inline context (embedded inside a
paragraph, for example), or in a block context.  In the former case, the expression
should be delimited between the characters '\code{\[$}' and '\code{\$]}' if it is written
in \caps{TeX} format, and between characters '\code{\<$}' and '\code{\$>}' if written
in \caps{MathML}.  Though \lambtex does not enforce it, common sense dictates that
inline mathematics should restrict themselves to expressions that fit comfortably in
a single line.  One example is the quadratic equation [$ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 $].

\caps{TeX} and \caps{MathML} mathematical expressions in a block context are specified
via the \code{mathtex} and \code{mathml} environments, respectively.  Furthermore,
because both these environments expect their content to be raw text that should be parsed
verbatim, they accept the \caps{heredoc} technique for delimiting the environment.
Suppose thus you wished to enter a math block containing the quadratic formula that
solves the equation listed above.  Specified in the \caps{TeX} format, the code would
be the following:

\begin{source}
\begin{mathtex}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{mathtex}
\end{source}

The equivalent Presentation \caps{MathML} markup is listed below.  Note that it is
also acceptable to provide Content \caps{MathML} instead of Presentation \caps{MathML}.
In either case, just make sure the markup conforms to version 2.0 of the \caps{MathML}
standard, and that the \code{math} top-level element that wraps the \caps{MathML}
contents is provided as part of the markup.  These requirements also apply to the
\caps{MathML} markup specified in an inline context.  On the other hand, giving
an explicit namespace to the \caps{MathML} markup is \bold{not} necessary, since
namespacing requirements are automatically taken care of.

\begin{source}
\begin{mathml}
<math>
	<mrow>
	    <mi>x</mi>
	    <mo>=</mo>
	    <mfrac>
		<mrow>
		    <mo form="prefix">&minus;</mo>
		    <mi>b</mi>
		    <mo>&PlusMinus;</mo>
		    <msqrt>
			<msup>
			    <mi>b</mi>
			    <mn>2</mn>
			</msup>
			<mo>&minus;</mo>
			<mn>4</mn>
			<mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>
			<mi>a</mi>
			<mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>
			<mi>c</mi>
		    </msqrt>
		</mrow>
		<mrow>
		    <mn>2</mn>
		    <mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>
		    <mi>a</mi>
		</mrow>
	    </mfrac>
	</mrow>
</math>
\end{mathml}
\end{source}

The equation resulting from either of the above sources is shown below.  To conclude,
bear in mind that in similarity with other types of blocks, \lambtex also supports
named mathematical expressions that may be numbered and referenced from anywhere in
a document.  For that you need to wrap a \code{mathtex} or \code{mathml} environment
inside an \code{equation} block.  This technique is part of the advanced features of
the language and is discussed with greater detail in \sref{sec:wrappers}.

\begin{mathtex}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{mathtex}


\section{Images}

The simple command \code{\\image} is used for inserting an image into the
document.  It takes the form \code{\\image\{\emph{identifier}\}\{\emph{alt}\}},
where \code{\emph{identifier}} is the name of the image (typically the filename),
and \code{\emph{alt}} is the alternative text to be displayed if the browser cannot
or is not configured to display images.  Both parameters consist of raw text and
are mandatory.  The bitmap below illustrates the use of a image block; the image
is shown in its default centered position, though facilities exist for placing it
on the left or right of the page and embedded within the flow of the paragraph text
(see \sref{sec:decor} for details).

\image{circle.png}{This is a circle}

Note that in most browsers you cannot see the alternative text unless the browser is
configured not to display images.  As for the code that produced the image, it is as
simple as this:

\begin{source}
\image{circle.png}{This is a circle}
\end{source}

There are additional configuration options for images, all set via optional extra
parameters.  Like its name suggests, the boolean parameter \code{frame} adds a small
framed shadow to the image.  It is off by default, and esthetically it is more sensible
for rectangular images such as photographs.  The size of the image can be controlled
by the parameter \code{width}.  Its value is either \code{auto} or an integer between 1
and 100 (inclusive), indicating the percentage of the total width of the page that the
image should occupy (minus a small margin common to all non-text blocks).  The default
is \code{auto}, which translates into an image occupying its natural width in pixels
(up to the maximum width of the page).  Note that images are always clickable and that
the target \caps{uri} is that of the image itself.  This is useful, for example, for
seeing at their full size images that were scaled down with the \code{width} parameter
or that did not fit into the width of the page.

It is a common practice to add a numbered caption to an image.  To achieve this in
\lambtex you must wrap the \code{image} block inside a \code{figure}, as described
in \sref{sec:wrappers}.  Images may also be used strictly for decorative purposes, in
which case they may be floated to the left or right of the page.  This is however part
of the advanced features of the language and is discussed only in \sref{sec:floaters}.


\section[sec:subpage]{Sub-pages}

Another interesting \lambtex feature is the ability to display child documents
inside a framed block.  These nested documents, termed \emph{sub-pages}, are offered
by the \code{subpage} environment.  While in general their usage is very limited and
it is unlikely you will ever need to use sub-pages, for some applications --- namely
writing manuals about \lambtex --- they are indispensable.

Sub-pages are not completely independent documents.  You may refer to elements inside
a sub-page from the main document and vice-versa.  Moreover, any notes and bibliography
entries (see \mbox{Sections \ref{sec:onnotes} and \ref{sec:onbiblio}}) declared inside a
sub-page are still associated with the main document.  Finally, take into consideration
that \lambtex will not automatically assign an ordering for sections and wrapper blocks
declared inside sub-pages (these blocks are part of the advanced language features
and are discussed in \sref{sec:headings} and \sref{sec:wrappers}, respectively).

You have already encountered several examples of sub-pages while reading this document,
as they have been used to illustrate the output of the composer in association with
each code sample.  The example below is the code that was used to produce the very first
sub-page you have encountered in this document, back in the \mref{sec:paragraphs}{section
on paragraph blocks}.

\begin{source}
\begin{subpage}
This is the first example of a paragraph.  Note that
it is composed of inline text.

Lines can be broken at any point, because a paragraph
is only terminated by a blank line. \br
It is however possible to manually insert a line break
without terminating the paragraph.

\p{There is also a simple command that allows the
explicit declaration of a paragraph.}
\end{subpage}
\end{source}


\section{The story thus far}

This first part of the manual covered all the basic features of \lambtex.  These allow
you to write documents that in the \lambdoc parlance are termed \emph{compositions}.
The reader will have noted, however, that none of the commands discussed thus far can
be used for creating documents with internal links.  All commands that do have that
property, either directly or indirectly, are considered part of the advanced features
of the language, and are covered in the sections that follow.


\part[part:advanced]{Advanced features}


\section{What exactly makes a feature \emph{advanced}?}

As we briefly alluded to in this manual's prelude, the \lambdoc library makes
a stark demarcation between basic and advanced features.  The basic rationale is
that one may wish to use the library to handle two different classes of documents.
We term \emph{compositions} those that do not contain internal links, do not produce
numbered blocks, and do not have a complex internal structure requiring sectioning.
In contrast, \emph{manuscripts} are documents that may make use of all these features.
To be more precise, besides using any of the features discussed in \sref{part:basic},
a manuscript is also endowed with all the properties listed below, which are addressed
individually in the sections that follow.

\begin{itemize}
\item	May be internally divided into multiple \mref{sec:headings}{parts and sections},
	each of which may be given a label so that it can be \mref{sec:intlinks}{referenced}
	from anywhere in the document.

\item	Allows the definition of \mref{sec:pull}{pull-quotes}.

\item	Allows the declaration of custom \mref{sec:boxouts}{boxouts} and
	\mref{sec:theorems}{theorem-like environments}.

\item	May use \mref{sec:wrappers}{wrappers} around basic blocks such as mathematics,
	verbatim environments, or figures.  A wrapper allows you to give a label and
	a caption to the block.

\item	Enables pull-quotes, boxouts, and wrappers to be \mref{sec:floaters}{floated
	to the left or right} of the page.  Furthermore, images and verbatim environments
	may be placed inside \mref{sec:decor}{decorative} blocks, allowing them to
	also be floated.

\item	Has facilities typically associated with the frontmatter of a document, such
	as \mref{sec:frontmatter}{titles and abstracts}.  Moreover, it allows also the
	creation of \mref{sec:onappendix}{appendices}.

\item	Allows you to define \mref{sec:onnotes}{notes} and \mref{sec:onbiblio}{bibliographic
	references}.

\item	Has facilities for the declaration and use of simple \mref{sec:macros}{macros}
	for textual substitution.
\end{itemize}


\section[sec:headings]{Parts and sections}

\lambtex supports three different levels of sectioning: sections, sub-sections, and
sub-sub-sections.  The simple commands used for declaring each one are \code{\\section},
\code{\\subsection}, and \code{\\subsubsection}, respectively.  These are automatically
ordered by \lambtex.  If you want to declare an unordered section, you must use an empty
ordering parameter.  Remember that ordering parameters are usually optional, and are
declared by enclosing between parenthesis the order you want to attribute. An empty order
simply means that only the opening and closing parenthesis should be present, without
any characters between them.  (Sectional commands declared inside sub-pages do require
an explicit ordering parameter, empty or not; check \sref{sec:order} for details).

In addition to sections, \lambtex documents may be also divided into \emph{parts}.
Parts are a higher-level division than sections, and are typically only used in
fairly complex documents.  This manual, for example, uses parts for making a clear
distinction between the basic and the advanced language features, and for marking
the appendix sections.  Note that a new part is declared with the homonymous simple
command \code{\\part}, and that it does not reset the section counter.  In similarity
to sections, parts can also be unordered.

Another common requirement associated with sectioning is the ability to refer to a given
part or section in a document.  With that in mind, \lambtex allows you to label a given
part or section declaration, and as described in the \mref{sec:intlinks}{following
section}, provides also a set of commands that create hyperlinks to a given label.
The label parameter is always optional and is enclosed in square brackets:

\begin{source}
\part{Prelude}

\section{Introduction}

For more details, please check Section \ref{sec:details}.

\subsection[sec:details]{This is a sub-section}

\subsubsection(){This is an unordered sub-sub-section}

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog.
\end{source}

The output produced by the \lambtex composer is as follows:

\begin{subpage}
\part(1){Prelude}

\section(1){Introduction}

For more details, please check Section 1.1.

\subsection(1.1)[sec:details]{This is a sub-section}

\subsubsection(){This is an unordered sub-sub-section}

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy brown dog.
\end{subpage}

To conclude, and since this is our first encounter with label parameters, the reader
should note that labels have two constraints.  First, the allowed character set is
limited to lowercase roman letters, digits, and the characters '\code{.}' (period),
'\code{:}' (colon), '\code{-}' (dash), and '\code{_}' (underscore).  Second, the first
character must be a letter.  Also note that all labels share the same namespace; we
recommend adopting the \caps{LaTeX} custom of using a prefix indicating the target
type.  In the example above, the prefix \code{sec:} is used for the sectioning family
of commands.


\section[sec:intlinks]{Internal hyperlinks}

\lambtex supports hyperlinks both to external resources and into targets in
the same document.  The former is provided by the already described simple command
\code{\\link}, whereas the latter relies on a set of different simple commands, each
one tailored for a different use and/or kind of target.  \sref{tab:hyperlinks} lists
all available hyperlinks commands, and the following source illustrates their use:

\begin{source}
You can easily insert a link into an external resource such
as \link{http://www.wikipedia.com/}{Wikipedia}.  Internal
links come into several guises: they can be references to
notes\see{note:meta}; bibliographic references like those
available in \caps{LaTeX}\cite{bib:latex}; pointers to
labelled figures, tables, printouts, equations, or sections
such as \mbox{Section \ref{sec:anatomy}}; smart references to
those same elements such as \sref{sec:anatomy}; and finally,
references where the order is not automatically added (for
example, you may refer yet again \mref{sec:anatomy}{to that
same section}).
\end{source}

The corresponding output of the composer is the following:

\begin{subpage}
You can easily insert a link into an external resource such
as \link{http://www.wikipedia.com/}{Wikipedia}.  Internal
links come into several guises: they can be references to
notes\see{note:meta}; bibliographic references like those
available in \caps{LaTeX}\cite{bib:latex}; pointers to
labelled figures, tables, printouts, equations, or sections
such as \mbox{Section \ref{sec:anatomy}}; smart references to
those same elements such as \sref{sec:anatomy}; and finally,
references where the order is not automatically added (for
example, you may refer yet again \mref{sec:anatomy}{to that
same section}).
\end{subpage}

\begin[note:meta]{note}
This is a meta-note, a note about notes.  It is used to demonstrate the declaration
of notes.
\end{note}

Bear in mind that the use of the smart references offered by command \code{\\sref}
is strongly recommended over the manual references provided by command \code{\\ref}.
The reason is three-fold.  First, because smart references ensure the consistent use
of one naming scheme over an entire document and across several documents.  Second,
because smart references automatically make sure that a non-breaking space is inserted
between the element name and its ordering number, thus preventing their separation
by a line break (to achieve the same effect with manual references, the user must
explicitly place both elements inside an \code{\\mbox} command, or use the \code{nbsp}
\caps{html} entity).  Third and last, because smart references will make a hyperlink
of both the name and the ordering, which is friendlier for mouse clicking and arguably
esthetically more pleasant.

On a related note, we recommend that \code{\\see} and \code{\\cite} commands not be
separated from the preceding element by spaces.  The default \caps{css} stylesheet
shipped with \lambtex already adds a small margin, and by not having spaces you
avoid the split across line breaks or the need to resort to the \code{\\mbox} command
or the \code{nbsp} \caps{html} entity.

\begin[tab:hyperlinks]{table}
{The various hyperlinking commands available in \lambtex.  Note that the
\code{\emph{uri}} and \code{\emph{label}} sequences are interpreted as raw
text.  Moreover, the inline sequence may be ommited in command \code{\\link},
and commands \code{\\see} and \code{\\cite} may be given more than one curly
bracketed \code{\emph{label}} sequence (see \mbox{Sections \ref{sec:onnotes}
and \ref{sec:onbiblio}} for details on the latter).}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Command						| Description |
\body
| \mbox{\code{\\link\{\emph{uri}\}\{\emph{inline}\}}}	| Inserts a link to an external resource. |
| \code{\\see\{\emph{label}\}}				| Refers to a document note (see \sref{sec:onnotes}). |
| \code{\\cite\{\emph{label}\}}				| Cites a bibliographic reference (see \sref{sec:onbiblio}). |
| \code{\\ref\{\emph{label}\}}				| Inserts a link to a numbered section, part, equation, printout, table, figure, boxout, or theorem.  The text under the hyperlink is the order of the reference. |
| \code{\\sref\{\emph{label}\}}				| Inserts a \emph{smart} reference to numbered section, part, equation, printout, table, figure, boxout, or theorem.  Besides the order, smart references also include the name of the kind of reference they are linking to. |
| \mbox{\code{\\mref\{\emph{label}\}\{\emph{inline}\}}}	| Inserts a reference to a section, part, equation, printout, table, figure, boxout, or theorem, but without including the order.  Instead, the description provided as the second mandatory parameter is used for the hyperlink. |
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section[sec:pull]{Pull-quotes}

\begin{pull}{Homer Simpson}
Weaseling out of things is important to learn:
it's what separates us from the animals.
Except the weasel.
\end{pull}

In typography, the special quotations such as the one above are termed \emph{pull-quotes}
or \emph{lift-out quotes}.  Pull-quotes serve a different purpose than the regular
quotation blocks introduced in a \mref{sec:quotations}{previous} section.  Whereas
quotation blocks are almost exclusively used to quote an excerpt from an external source,
pull-quotes are most commonly used to quote a passage from the very same document
where they are defined.  Though this may seem redundant, that is precisely the point:
pull-quotes are an effective way to emphasise key passages from the text.

This block type is declared using the \code{pull} environment command, and accepts an
optional primary parameter consisting of an inline sequence specifying the authorship
of the quote.  Therefore, to produce a pull-quote like the one that opens this section,
you can simply provide the following code:

\begin{source}
\begin{pull}{Homer Simpson}
Weaseling out of things is important to learn:
it's what separates us from the animals.
Except the weasel.
\end{pull}
\end{source}

In similarity to their regular counterparts, the usefulness of pull-quotes carries with
it a warning against abuse.  Though one may be tempted to make heavy use of this feature,
bear in mind that its effectiveness goes down as their usage is increased.  Moreover,
it tends to make more sense for longer manuscripts, and/or when it is floated to the
left or right (the concept of floating blocks is described in \sref{sec:floaters}).


\section[sec:boxouts]{Declaring and using boxouts}

\newboxout{warning}{Warning}
\begin{warning}{Boxout overload}
Boxouts are like quotation blocks:
they are most effective when not abused!
\end{warning}

Boxout blocks allow you emphasise a document fragment by placing it inside a box.
Boxouts are useful for warnings, notices, tips, reminders, etc.  Boxouts are custom
environments, in the sense that the command name that appears in the begin/end pairs
is not built-in and is instead defined in the document itself.  Therefore, before a
boxout is used, it must first be declared via the simple command \code{\\newboxout}.
Moreover, boxouts are optionally titled and may be given an automatic ordering.

The command \code{\\newboxout} accepts at least one, and up to three primary parameters.
The first parameter is the name of the boxout environment; this is the same name that
must subsequently be used inside the begin/end pairs.  Obviously, you may not name
a boxout with the same designation of an existing command, or with a designation
that begins with the name of an environment that uses the \caps{heredoc} technique
(namely \code{verbatim}, \code{source}, \code{mathtex}, and \code{mathml}). Moreover,
the name must begin with a lowercase letter and be composed only of lowercase letters
and digits.  The second parameter, if present, is an inline sequence indicating a fixed
title that will appear in all boxouts of this name.  Finally, the third parameter may
be used to assign a counter to this boxout.  If not present, the boxout is unnumbered;
moreover, different boxouts may share the same counter.  Note that the third parameter
may only be given for boxouts that do have a title, and thus also a second parameter.
In addition, bear in mind that counter identifiers must follow the same rules laid out
for labels, as described in \sref{sec:headings}.  Counter identifiers do nevertheless
reside in their own separate namespace, independent of that of labels.

Subsequent to its declaration, using a new boxout named \code{\emph{name}} is
simply a matter of wrapping its contents between \code{\\begin\{\emph{name}\}} and
\code{\\end\{\emph{name}\}}.  The begin tag accepts an optional primary parameter with an
extra title to assign to the boxout.  If the \code{\\newboxout} boxout declaration did
not include a title, then this extra title becomes the sole title for this particular
instance of the boxout.  If on the other hand \code{\\newboxout} already declared a
generic title, then the extra title is appended to the generic title.  Should neither
a generic nor an extra title be given, then the boxout will be titleless.

Suppose thus you wished to display a warning boxout like the one that opens this section.
It makes sense to name it \code{warning}, and for each instance of the boxout to include
the generic title \emph{``Warning''}.  Moreover, you do not wish for warnings to be
numbered, so you should not assign a counter to it.  As for this particular instance
of the boxout, you wish the extra title \emph{``Boxout overload''} to be appended to
the generic title (note that the colon separating the generic and instance-specific
titles is automatically inserted as needed, so you do not need to include it manually).
 All these considerations can be realised with the following code:

\begin{source}
\newboxout{warning}{Warning}

\begin{warning}{Boxout overload}
Boxouts are like quotation blocks:
they are most effective when not abused!
\end{warning}
\end{source}

At this point you may be wondering where does the customised warning sign
come from.  Its origin is simple: for each boxout named \code{\emph{name}}, the
\caps{xhtml} output driver from the \lambdoc library will include the classname
\code{doc_boxout_env_\emph{name}} in the \caps{div} element that encapsulates the
boxout.  The \caps{css} supplied with the library takes advantage of this metadata,
and contains sample customisation for boxouts named \code{warning} and \code{tip}.
This trick provides an easy way to customise your own boxouts.

To conclude note that boxouts may be labelled, and that you may request the supression
of ordering for individual instances of numbered boxouts.  The latter is achieved in
the same manner as with sections and parts: by providing the empty ordering declaration
\code{()}.  Labelled boxouts may be referenced from anywhere in the document via the
simple commands \code{\\ref}, \code{\\sref}, or \code{\\mref} (the two former commands
may only be used for numbered boxouts, obviously).


\section[sec:theorems]{Theorem-like environments}

Theorems and their kin such as corollaries, lemmas, etc, are a staple of mathematical
and computer-science writing.  For this reason, \lambtex also supports them.
In practice, theorem-like environments are declared and used in pretty much the same
way as boxouts.  The major difference is that the declaration of a new theorem is
done via the simple command \code{\\newtheorem}.  Moreover, theorems must always
have a title, and therefore the declaration has two mandatory primary parameters.
Similarly to boxouts, \code{\\newtheorem} may optionally include a third primary
parameter specifying the counter if you wish the theorem to be numbered.  Note that
even though the same counter may be shared between multiple theorem-like environments,
you may not share a counter between a boxout and a theorem.  Because all counters
share the same namespace, you must make sure collisions do not occur.

Suppose thus you wish to create a theorem named \code{theorem}, and whose title is,
unsurprisingly, \emph{``Theorem''}.  Moreover, you want the theorem to be numbered,
and its counter to be called \code{cnt:theorem}.  One particular instantiation of
this theorem has the extra title \emph{``John McAuthor''}, reflecting its authorship.
This is the \lambtex source you may use:

\begin{source}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}{cnt:theorem}

\begin{theorem}{John McAuthor}
Let an egg be defined as an ellipsoid whose radii across the [$x$],
[$y$], and [$z$] axes are respectively [$a$], [$b$], and [$c$].
Furthermore, the egg satisfies the scalene condition, and therefore
[$a > b > c$].  All such eggs are optimally opened by their small-end.
\end{theorem}
\end{source}

The resulting output is shown below.  Note that in theorems the extra title is displayed
between parentheses, in accordance to convention.  Should you wish to customise the
\caps{css} for particular classes of theorems, you may make use of the same technique
described for boxouts.  Note, however, that for a theorem named \code{\emph{name}},
the associated classname is \code{doc_theorem_env_\emph{name}}.

\begin{subpage}
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}{cnt:theorem}

\begin(1){theorem}{John McAuthor}
Let an egg be defined as an ellipsoid whose radii across the [$x$],
[$y$], and [$z$] axes are respectively [$a$], [$b$], and [$c$].
Furthermore, the egg satisfies the scalene condition, and therefore
[$a > b > c$].  All such eggs are optimally opened by their small-end.
\end{theorem}
\end{subpage}


\section[sec:wrappers]{Wrappers}

As discussed in \sref{part:basic}, \lambdoc allows compositions to declare document
blocks beyond simple paragraphs of text.  Tabular environments, images, mathematics,
or source-code listings, for example.  All of these are anonymous blocks, in the sense
they do not have an associated label and therefore cannot be referenced from elsewhere
in the document (remember that internal references are not allowed in compositions).
When writing a manuscript, however, there are valid reasons why you may want to
reference an image or a source-code listing, or to provide these elements with a caption.
It it for this motive that \lambtex also offers blocks that may be given a caption, an
ordering, and may be referred from anywhere.  These blocks are called \emph{wrappers},
and as their name implies, are essentially just a wrapper around other blocks such
as \code{source}, \code{tabular}, \code{mathtex}, or \code{mathml} environments.
There are four different classes of wrappers available:

\begin{description}

\item{Equations}

	These are declared via the environment command \code{equation},
	and may be used for wrapping \code{mathtex} and \code{mathml} blocks.

\item{Printouts}

	These are used for wrapping \code{source} environments, and are
	declared with the environment command \code{printout}.

\item{Tables}

	Tables may only be used for wrapping \code{tabular} environments,
	and are declared with the environment command \code{table}.

\item{Figures}

	Finally, figures are declared with the environment command
	\code{figure}, and may be used for wrapping \code{verbatim},
	\code{image}, and \code{subpage} blocks.

\end{description}

All these classes have two features in common: they may all be captioned, and each
class has an associated counter that is automatically incremented whenever a new
wrapper is declared.  Moreover, wrappers always have an associated ordering, and
thus requesting an empty ordering with \code{()} is not allowed.  Note also that the
wrapper itself may be labelled.  The code below illustrates the use of a \code{figure}
wrapper around a \code{image} block:

\begin{source}
\begin[fig:example]{figure}{This is the figure's caption.}
\image{circle.png}{This is a circle}
\end{figure}
\end{source}

Remember that captioning is optional.  When present, the caption is an inline sequence
declared as a primary parameter of the wrapper environment.  Should it not be given, the
counter associated with the wrapper is displayed between parentheses below the wrapped
block.  Also, you can refer to this figure from anywhere in the document by using the
label \code{fig:example} with any of the simple commands \code{\\ref}, \code{\\sref},
and \code{\\mref}.  The resulting figure (\sref{fig:example}) is shown below:

\begin[fig:example]{figure}{This is the figure's caption.}
\image{circle.png}{This is a circle}
\end{figure}


\section[sec:floaters]{Floating blocks left or right}

In all the examples presented so far, blocks have been centered and shown occupying
the entire width of the page.  For reasons of style this method of presentation is not
always optimal, however.  Instead, it is often preferable for blocks to be embedded
within the flow of the text.  With this in mind, pull-quotes, boxouts, wrappers, and
decoration blocks (see \mref{sec:decor}{next section}) all accept an optional extra
parameter named \code{float} that tells \lambtex whether the block should be placed
in the \code{center} (the default), or at the \code{left} or \code{right} of the page.
These blocks are collectively known as \emph{floaters}.

You may have noticed that the only blocks allowed to float to the side of the page are
those that may safely be removed from the main flow of the document.  These blocks
are not tied to a precise location of the document (that is, it won't matter much
if they are placed a couple of paragraphs above or below, as long as they can be
found in the relevant section), and they have a fair degree of independence from the
contents in the main flow.  It is for this reason that you may not directly float, say,
a \code{source} block.  It carries no context by itself, and thus must be integrated
into the main flow, or wrapped inside a \code{printout} whose caption and/or ordering
provide the needed context.  Theorems --- even though they have some independence and
provide their own context --- are excluded from the set of blocks allowed to float.
The rationale stems mainly from customary usage, where theorems are integrated into
the main flow of the document.

\begin<right>{pull}
Use floating blocks sparingly for maximum effect.
\end{pull}

Note that a particularly common application of the floating feature is to display
a pull-quote on the right or left side of the page, such as the one that accompanies
this paragraph.  However, and for maximum effect, this feature should be used sparingly,
an advice that in general applies to all floating blocks.


\section[sec:decor]{Decorations}

The case can be made that images are often used for purely decorative purposes, and
should therefore be allowed to float even when not located inside a figure wrapper.
A straightforward solution would therefore allow the specification of the \code{float}
extra parameter also in unwrapped images.  This approach would, however, run afoul of
the strict demarcation between compositions and manuscripts espoused by the \lambdoc
library, since floating elements should only be allowed in manuscripts but images are
composition blocks.

The solution ultimately chosen hinges on the decorative nature of isolated floating
images, which should therefore be semantically marked as such by wrapping them inside
\code{decor} environments.  This type of block is reserved for manuscripts and may be
floated via the extra parameter \code{float}.  \lambdoc principles are thus preserved
and manuscripts gain floating images as an additional feature.

Note that being decorative in nature, \code{decor} blocks may not be labelled and are
thus unreferenceable.  Moreover, because the \code{verbatim} environment is typically
used for \caps{ascii}-art and therefore can be said to also produce images, the block
wrapped inside a decoration may be either an \code{image} or \code{verbatim}.


\section[sec:frontmatter]{Frontmatter: title, abstract, and table of contents}

This section addresses three semantic elements associated with large manuscripts
and which are placed before the main body of the document, at the so-called
\emph{frontmatter}.  These elements are titles and sub-titles, the abstract, and the
table of contents.

Titles in \lambtex are declared via the aptly named \code{\\title} command.
This is a simple command that takes an inline sequence as parameter.  Closely related
is the also simple command \code{\\subtitle}.  It is typically used for showing the
document's author, date, or actual sub-titles.

\caps{LaTeX} users are familiar with a richer set of sub-titles that includes special
commands for specifying the author and date.  There is obviously a trade-off between
increasing language complexity and improving semantic richness.  On this continuum,
\lambtex sits further along than plain \caps{TeX} on the direction towards semantic
richness.  However, the awareness of increased language complexity is ever-present,
and weights heavily on decisions such as this one.  It is for this reason that the
language offers a catch-all \code{\\subtitle} command instead of multiple commands
tailored to each particular application.

Abstracts are commonly found on scientific papers, and \lambtex supports them as
well.  An abstract is declared by enclosing one or more embeddable blocks within an
\code{abstract} environment.  Please consult \sref{sec:structure} for more details on
what constitutes a \emph{embeddable block}, and note the source fragment below for an
example of the various frontmatter blocks.

\begin{source}
\title{Small-endian vs big-endian: the solution}
\subtitle{John McAuthor}
\subtitle{February 2009}

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an irrefutable solution to the age-old question
of whether eggs should be opened by the small-end or the big-end.
Many insightful arguments shall be presented. (...)
\end{abstract}
\end{source}

This is the result produced by the \lambtex composer:

\begin{subpage}
\title{Small-endian vs big-endian: the solution}
\subtitle{John McAuthor}
\subtitle{February 2009}

\begin{abstract}
This paper presents an irrefutable solution to the age-old question
of whether eggs should be opened by the small-end or the big-end.
Many insightful arguments shall be presented. (...)
\end{abstract}
\end{subpage}

Finally, you can request that a table of contents be printed by issueing the
parameterless simple command \code{\\toc}.  This can be done at any place in the
document, though convention and reason suggest that it be placed at the very beginning.
Note that even though \code{\\toc} lacks any primary parameters (which in \lambtex are
always enclosed in curly brackets), it does accepts an optional label parameter.  This is
useful for referencing the table of contents from anywhere in the document.  Also, bear
in mind that the table of contents itself does not appear in the table of contents!
You may verify this fact in this manual's own \mref{sec:toc}{table of contents}.

\section{Rules}

A typographic rule is commonly used in fiction pieces to clearly separate unrelated
paragraphs.  For the sake of completeness, \lambtex supports also this feature.
You may declare it using the \code{\\rule} simple command, or its synonym \code{\\hr}.
These commands are completely parameterless, as the code sample below demonstrates:

\begin{source}
This is a paragraph.

\rule

This is another paragraph.
\end{source}

The generated \caps{xhtml} result depends of course on the installed \caps{css}.
The default stylesheet produces the following result:

\begin{subpage}
This is a paragraph.

\rule

This is another paragraph.
\end{subpage}


\section[sec:onnotes]{Adding notes to a document}

Markup languages such as \caps{LaTeX}, whose roots stem from page-oriented designs,
have the concept of a \emph{footnote}.  \lambtex is targeted at web publishing,
a domain where the concept of a document being composed of individual pages is not
meaningful.  For this reason, \lambtex's equivalent concept is that of notes
attached to the end of the document.

A note is declared via the environment command \code{note}.  Notes can of course be
labelled, and may be referenced from anywhere in the document via the simple command
\code{\\see}.  The latter takes at least one primary parameter, and therefore you may
reference multiple notes simply by providing additional primary parameters.

One important feature to remember is that the location where the note is declared
is \bold{not} the same as where it will be appear in the rendered document (for this
reason, notes are termed \emph{ghost blocks}).  Instead,  all notes will be printed
together wherever the simple command \code{\\notes} is declared.  This last command will
also create an eponymously named unordered section, just like \mref{sec:thenotes}{the
one present} in this manual.  This ``ghostly'' character of note blocks allows them
to be declared anywhere in the document, a handy feature if you wish to keep a note
declaration close to the place where it is declared.

The sample code below illustrates a note being referenced inside a paragraph and being
defined afterwards.  The example concludes with the simple command \code{\\notes}
requesting the printing of the homonymous section together with the defined note.

\begin{source}
This is a normal\see{note:example} paragraph that references
an end-document note.  You may read all notes declared in the
document \mref{sec:notes}{in this section}.

\begin[note:example]{note}
And by 'normal' we mean 'not normal'.
\end{note}

\notes[sec:notes]
\end{source}


\section[sec:onbiblio]{Adding a bibliography}

Similarly to notes, bibliographic entries are also ghost blocks.  Therefore,
you may declare them anywhere in the document, and they will only be printed when
you issue the simple command \code{\\bibliography}.  Each individual bibliographic
entry is contained within an environment command \code{bib}, which itself accepts
three sub-blocks, defined by the simple commands \code{\\who}, \code{\\what}, and
\code{\\where}.  These blocks are used for defining the author, the title, and the
location (journal, proceedings, web page) of the bibliographic reference, respectively.

The code below illustrates the declaration of a bibliographic entry.  Note that the
entry is referenced by the simple command \code{\\cite}.  Also, and in similarity to
the command \code{\\see}, it is possible to reference multiple entries with a single
invocation of \code{\\cite}, since this command accepts multiple primary parameters.

\begin{source}
\caps{lambtex} is largely inspired by LaTeX\cite{bib:latex}.

\begin[bib:latex]{bib}
\who{Leslie Lamport}
\what{LaTeX: a Document Preparation System (2\sup{nd} edition)}
\where{Addison-Wesley Professional, 1994, ISBN 0-201-52983-1}
\end{bib}
\end{source}

Whereas \caps{BibTeX}\cite{bib:bibtex} offers a very rich set of tags for bibliographic
entries (author, title, journal volume, page numbers, conference location, etc),
\lambtex limits this set to only three main tags.  Those familiar with \caps{BibTeX}
may feel constrained by this paucity.  However, one must take into account that \lambtex
was designed with the web as a foremost application area.  In this context, one can
have satisfactory --- in the sense that they are readily accessible --- bibliographic
entries based solely on a hyperlink.  The \code{\\where} command can therefore be used
for linking to an external web resource, or if not available online, to provide all
the miscelaneous information required to locate the resource in ``dead tree world''.


\section[sec:onappendix]{Creating an appendix}

Large manuscripts typically have fragments that do not fit into the main flow of
the document.  In many cases, these fragments can satisfactorily be included as notes
(remember \sref{sec:onnotes}).  In other situations, however, it may make more sense
to attach them as appendices to the main document.  In \lambtex, creating an appendix
is simply a matter of issueing the simple parameterless command \code{\\appendix}.
Besides declaring an unordered part of the same name, this command also marks all
subsequent sections as belonging to the appendix.  This means that an appendiced
section is declared the usual way, via the command \code{\\section} (the same applies
to sub-sections and sub-sub-sections, of course).  The only distinguishing aspect that
makes it an appendiced section is being declared after \code{\\appendix}.

You can see an example of appendiced sections in this very manual.  Note how all
sections declared after the \mref{part:theappendix}{appendix marker} are automatically
ordered using alphabetic characters instead of numbers, as per the usual convention.
Smart references produced by command \code{\\sref} automatically adjust as well ---
yet another reason why you should avoid its ``dumb'' counterpart \code{\\ref}.


\section[sec:macros]{Macros}

\lambtex offers limited macro functionality in manuscripts.  Macros provide simple
textual replacement, possibly parameterised.  Note that these are not full-blown
programming constructs, being instead aimed at reducing boilerplate and ensuring
consistent formatting of common text patterns.

Before being used, a macro must be declared via the simple command \code{\\newmacro}.
This command takes three mandatory primary parameters: the name of the macro, the number
of arguments, and an inline sequence containing the text of the macro.  Macro names
must obviously be unique and not overlap with the names of built-in commands, but they
live in their own private namespace.  Moreover, and similarly to boxouts and theorems,
the name must begin with a lowercase roman letter and be followed by a combination of
lowercase roman letters and digits.

Should the macro take any arguments, these can be referenced from inside the macro
text by the alias \code{\\arg\{\emph{num}\}}, where the \code{\emph{num}} between curly
brackets is an integer indicating the argument number.  Obviously, a macro with [$n$]
arguments may not reference an argument [$n+1$] or higher.  Moreover, arguments are
expanded as inline sequences.

Wherever an inline sequence is accepted, a macro named \code{name} can be invoked via
the simple command \code{\\name}.  The invocation of the macro causes the macro's text
to be inserted at invocation point.  Should the macro have any arguments, these must
follow the macro's name immediately, being each one bracketed individually.  Therefore,
the invocation of macro \code{name} with arguments \code{inline1} and \code{inline2}
is done with \mbox{\code{\\name\{inline1\}\{inline2\}}}.  Note that because macros
can be invoked wherever an inline sequence is accepted and the text of a macro is
an inline sequence itself, it follows that macros may invoke other macros.  However,
because a macro must be declared before being invoked, mutual recursion is not allowed.
Moreover, a macro may not invoke itself either.  These restrictions are in place to
ensure that macro expansion always terminates.

While token concatenation with parameterised macros is straightforward, you may
wonder how it can be achieved with parameterless macros.  To illustrate this
issue, suppose you have defined a macro \code{super} that expands to the text
\emph{``super''}.  Now, you wish to concatenate the invocation of this macro with the
text \emph{``market''}.  However, entering \code{\\super market} produces an unwanted
space, whereas \code{\\supermarket} produces an error, since the macro \code{supermarket}
is undefined.  Note that if the macro had any arguments this problem would be moot,
since the brackets naturally delimitate the macro name.  Therefore one solution is
to always declare macros with at least one parameter, even if it is a dummy that can
be discarded.  There is however a better alternative, one which takes advantage of
the fact that all commands accept (at least) an empty sequence as extra parameters:
simply put \code{<}&#8202;\code{>} after the macro name.  Concatenation in this example
can thus be achieved by entering \code{\\super<}&#8202;\code{>market}.

Let us now consider a full example of macro declaration.  We wish to define a macro
\code{author} that when invoked expands to the full name of an author.  We also
define a macro named \code{greet} that takes two arguments and produces a greeting.
These two macros are then used in a small sample document.  This is the \lambtex source:

\begin{source}
\newmacro{author}{0}{John McAuthor, of the small-ended approach,}
\newmacro{greet}{2}{Greetings \bold{\arg{1}} and welcome to \arg{2}}

It was then that \author reached his destination.  The gatekeeper said,
``\greet{\author}{this land}'', and there was much rejoicing.
\end{source}

And this is the resulting output:

\begin{subpage}
\newmacro{author}{0}{John McAuthor, of the small-ended approach,}
\newmacro{greet}{2}{Greetings \bold{\arg{1}} and welcome to \arg{2}}

It was then that \author reached his destination.  The gatekeeper said,
``\greet{\author}{this land}'', and there was much rejoicing.
\end{subpage}

Note that the arguments to a macro are inline text, and thus it is possible
for the argument to consist of the invocation of a macro.  On the other hand,
macros cannot be used to replace non-inline sequences of a command.


\section{Concluding remarks}

You are now familiar with the all the features available in the \lambtex markup language.
We hope you will find it rich enough to cover your web publishing needs, while still
being simple enough to dispense a significant investment of time learning it.

We advise that you peruse the appendices attached to this manual.  There you can find
some reference material that did not fit into the flow of the main body of the document.
\sref{sec:structure}, for example, discusses at length the structure of the \lambtex
documents, while \sref{sec:synonyms} summarises all command synonyms available,
and \sref{sec:parameters} covers all you need to know concerning optional arguments.
Unless you are writing about \lambtex itself, there is little chance you will need the
information contained in \sref{sec:order}.  But if you do, it focuses on the somewhat
arcane aspects concerning numbering in sub-pages.  Finally, \sref{sec:extra} contains
all the nitty-gritty details about how extra arguments are parsed.


\appendix[part:theappendix]


\section[sec:structure]{The structure of \lambtex documents}

We described a \lambtex document as being composed of a list of blocks, with some
of these blocks being themselves composed of other blocks.  We have, however, glossed
over some of the restrictions imposed on this structure.  The goal of this section is
therefore to rectify that omission by providing a full account of the structure of a
\lambtex document.

Blocks come in different types.  Moreover, it is possible to establish a subtyping
hierarchy that relates the different block types. \sref{fig:hierarchy} illustrates that
hierarchy, showing block types inside rounded rectangles.  Concerning the subtyping
relation, an arrow pointing from a source block into a target block should be interpreted
as meaning that the source block is a subtype of the target, and dually, that the target
is a supertype of the source.  In practice, this means that a subtype block may be used
in any circumstance where its supertype is allowed.  However, the converse is not true.


\begin[fig:hierarchy]{figure}
{The subtyping hierarchy for \lambtex blocks.  An arrow pointing from a source
block to a target block indicates that the source is a subtype of the target and
is therefore accepted in any circumstances where the target would be accepted.
Compositions may use only blocks printed in green, whereas manuscripts may use
both green and blue blocks.}
\image{hierarchy.png}{Hierarchy}
\end{figure}


Two other things stand out in the figure.  The first is that blocks are grouped
into two broad categories: composition blocks (in green) and manuscript blocks (in
blue). Though not relevant to a discussion concerning structure, this categorisation
serves as a good, graphical reminder of which block types are allowed for composition
and manuscript document types.  Second, there is a list attached to each of the block
types.  This list indicates the actual document blocks that belong to that type.
An \emph{embeddable block}, for example, can be either a paragraph, an itemize,
enumerate, or description list, a verse block, a block containing mathematics, etc.
Notice that many blocks have a \emph{\code{of} ...} declaration after their name; these
blocks --- termed \emph{recursive blocks} --- are those whose contents are other blocks.


If a \lambtex document were unconstrained, one would expect a recursive block to
be composed of a list of super blocks.  Because super blocks sit at the top of the
hierarchy, \bold{any} block can be used where a super block is allowed.  Therefore,
in an unconstrained scenario, it would be perfectly legal for a quotation block to
be the parent of a section, or for an abstract block to include another.  Needless to
say, an unconstrained document would accommodate for pathological situations bearing
no resemblance to any reasonable real-world documents.  It is for this reason that a
\lambtex document has a few constraints in place.  As you shall see, these constraints
are however fairly minor and still allow for very flexible documents.

In basic terms, documents are constrained by limiting the types of blocks accepted
as children of recursive blocks.  The exact subtype allowed for each recursive block
is shown in the figure as an \emph{\code{of} ...} declaration after the block name.
Let us consider, for example, a quote block.  It only allows a list of \emph{quotable
blocks} as children.  This means that you cannot quote a figure nor an abstract, but
you can do so with any of the quotable blocks or subtypes (\emph{embeddable blocks},
namely).  Furthermore, these rules apply to the entire descendant tree.  This means
that if an itemize block is the child of a quote block, then the most restricted rules
of the parent apply also to the child's descendants.  In this case that would mean
that the itemize block would also only accept quotable blocks as children instead of
its usually more permissive allowance of any \emph{listable block}.  The exception to
this rule is the \code{subpage} block, which resets the hierarchy.


\section[sec:synonyms]{Command synonyms}

For reference purposes, \sref{tab:synonyms} lists all existing synonyms for both simple
and environment commands (the former's name is prefixed by a backslash).  Remember that
in the case of environment commands, the same name must be used for the \code{begin}
and \code{end} tags, even if they are synonyms.

\begin[tab:synonyms]{table}{List of all available command synonyms.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\section[sec:parameters]{Command parameters}

The typical simple command in \caps{LaTeX} has one or two primary parameters enclosed
between curly brackets.  In addition, many commands (both simple and environment) accept
also optional parameters that specify an ordering, a label, or any extra information.
When present, optional parameters may be specified in any order, as long as they
precede any of the primary parameters.  Moreover, each class of optional parameter is
distinguished by the set of characters used for delimitation.  Ordering parameters
are enclosed in curved brackets, labelling parameters in square brackets, and extra
parameters between angle brackets.

Note that not all optional parameters are meaningful for all existing commands.
Some commands may, for instance, accept only an order and/or a label parameter,
while others accept only extra parameters.  In fact, no command exists that accepts
all three classes of optional parameters, and there are several which accept none.
\sref{tab:permlist} lists the classes accepted for each of all existing commands,
both simple and environment ones.  An exact definition of the terms used is shown
in \sref{tab:permdesc}.


\begin[tab:permdesc]{table}
{Definition of the various permissions.  These terms are used in \sref{tab:permlist}.}
\begin{tabular}{cl}
\head
| Permission		| Definition							|
\body
| \optional		| The parameter is optional, but may not be empty if present.	|
| \optional0		| The parameter is optional, and may be empty.			|
| \mandatory		| The parameter is mandatory, and it may not be empty.		|
| \mandatory0		| The parameter is mandatory, but it may be empty.		|
| \forbidden		| The parameter is altogether forbidden.			|
| \forbidden0		| The parameter is forbidden, unless it is empty.		|
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As the \sref{tab:permlist} below confirms, it is always possible to specify empty extra
parameters for any command.  This is done so that token concatenation is possible for
simple commands that take no primary parameters, as is often the case with user-defined
macros.  A practical application of this feature is described in \sref{sec:macros}.

\begin[tab:permlist]{table}
{The permissions associated with the various \lambtex commands for each of the three classes
(order, label, and extra) of optional arguments.  In the case of extra parameters, the options
available for each command are also displayed.  Note that simple commands are shown prefixed
with a backslash, whereas environment commands are enclosed inside brackets.  Within each
category, commands are shown alphabetically.  Furthermore, the commands \code{\emph{\\macro}},
\code{\emph{boxout}} and \code{\emph{theorem}} are shown in italics because the actual command
name is user-defined.}

\section[sec:order]{Notes on ordering in the context of sub-pages}

This section applies to those blocks that have an associated ordering, namely wrapper
blocks, sectional blocks, and the custom blocks (boxouts and theorems).  Recall that a
wrapper is essentially a floater element with a caption and an order associated with it.
There are four elements in \lambtex that fit into this category: equations, printouts,
tables, and figures.  As for sectional blocks, these are the ones that produce parts,
sections, sub-sections, and sub-sub-sections.  There are some special --- though as
you shall see based on common sense --- rules that must be followed concerning the
order parameter and the hyperlinking of blocks with associated ordering, particularly
in the context of sub-pages.  The rules are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item
	Only numbered elements may be referred to using \code{\\ref} and \code{\\sref}
	commands:

	\p<!indent>{Unless the user explicitly demanded an empty ordering, sectional
	commands have by default a number.  As for wrappers, they always have an
	associated order.  In the case of custom environments, the situation varies.}

	It makes sense that the hyperlinking commands that are supposed to produce a
	number should only be used with wrappers, numbered sectional blocks, or numbered
	custom environments.  These commands are \code{\\ref} and \code{\\sref}.
	On the other hand, because \code{\\mref} does not output a number, it is
	always allowed.

\item
	You must explicitly provide a manual ordering for sub-paged wrappers, sectional
	blocks, or custom blocks:

	\p<!indent>{A sub-paged element is one that is declared inside a \code{subpage}
	block (see \sref{sec:subpage}).  Because they lie outside the main flow of the
	document, these elements are not automatically numbered.  You must therefore
	explicitly provide them with an ordering parameter.  This is done by inserting
	the numbering between parentheses.  Note that in the case of sectional commands
	or custom blocks an empty ordering is allowed.}

\item
	You may not provide a manual ordering for wrappers, sectional blocks, or custom
	blocks defined outside a sub-page:

	\p<!indent>{This rule is complementary to the previous one.  Because these
	blocks are numbered automatically by \lambtex when present in the main document,
	you may not interfere with that automatism by providing an explicit ordering.
	Note, however, that an empty ordering is always allowed for sectional commands
	or custom blocks.}

\end{enumerate}

\section[sec:extra]{Extra parameters}

Remember that extra parameters are those enclosed between angle brackets, and always
precede any mandatory parameters the command may have.  Canonically, specifying that a
parameter \code{alpha} should have a value \code{x} is done by declaring \code{alpha=x}
as the extra parameter.  Should the command accept multiple parameters, these can
be separated by inserting a '\code{,}' (comma) between them.  \sref{tab:extradesc}
below lists all the existing extra parameters together with the accepted values for each.

\begin[tab:extradesc]{table}
{List of all existing extra parameters and associated range of values.
Consult \sref{tab:permlist} for a list of which of these parameters are
accepted for each command.}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
\head
| Parameter		| Accepted values |
\body
| \code{initial}	| Boolean |
| \code{indent}		| Boolean or \code{auto} |
| \code{box}		| Boolean |
| \code{nums}		| Boolean |
| \code{zebra}		| Boolean |
| \code{mult}		| Integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive) |
| \code{frame}		| Boolean |
| \code{width}		| Integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), or \code{auto} |
| \code{bul}		| Discrete values: \code{disc}, \code{circle}, \code{square}, \code{none} |
| \code{num}		| Discrete values:
			\code{0}, \code{i}, \code{I}, \code{a}, \code{A},
			\code{decimal}, \code{lower-roman}, \code{upper-roman},
			\code{lower-alpha}, \code{upper-alpha}, \code{none} |
| \code{float}		| Discrete values: \code{center}, \code{left}, \code{right} |
| \code{class}		| A class name specification |
| \code{lang}		| Discrete values: \code{ocaml}, \code{c}, \code{java}, etc (any value accepted by the \link{http://camlhighlight.forge.ocamlcore.org/}{\caps{camlhighlight}} library) |
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Note that for brevity sake, \lambtex allows shorthand forms to be specified
instead of the canonical form.  The shorthand pre-conditions are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}

\item	It suffices to declare a value if there is no ambiguity as to which parameter
	it belongs to.	In the example above this means declaring simply \code{x}
	instead of \code{alpha=x}. Because \lambtex knows which values are valid
	for each parameter, and because there are practically no overlaps in the existing
	set of commands, this condition applies almost always.	The notable exception
	is the environment command \code{source}, which accepts three different boolean
	parameters (see \sref{tab:permlist}).

\item	Boolean parameters may be set by specifying the parameter name.  Therefore, if
	parameter \code{beta} is boolean, you may set it to true by declaring either
	\code{beta}, \code{beta=true}, \code{beta=y}, or if there are no other boolean
	parameters accepted for the command, just \code{true} or \code{y}.  Similarly,
	a boolean parameter may be unset by prefixing it with '\code{!}'.  Therefore,
	setting \code{beta} to false can be done by declaring either \code{!beta},
	\code{beta=false}, \code{beta=n}, or if there is no chance of conflict, just
	\code{false} or \code{n}.

\item	When setting multiple extra parameters, if one of the settings is
	provided in canonical form or as a boolean parameter name, then it can be used
	to constrain an otherwise ambiguous declaration.  Consider thus a command that
	takes two boolean extra parameters, \code{alpha} and \code{beta}.  Only providing
	the sequence \code{true} is ambiguous, because \lambtex has no way of
	knowing to which parameter it refers.  However, specifying \code{!alpha,true}
	is not ambiguous, because this can only be interpreted as setting parameter
	\code{alpha} to \code{false}, and the remaining parameter --- which can only
	be \code{beta} --- to \code{true}.

\end{enumerate}

As can be deduced from the above rules, \lambtex uses a basic constraint
satisfaction algorithm to resolve extra parameter declarations.  If the declaration
is unambiguous to a human, so it should be to \lambtex.
